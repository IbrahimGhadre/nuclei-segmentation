"""
divisione_in_patch.py - extract overlapping patches (image + mask) and save them to disk.

This function slides a fixed-size square window over each image/mask pair and
creates overlapping patches. Each patch is then saved to disk with a filename
that encodes:
    - i  -> index of the source image in the dataset (1-based)
    - k  -> row index of the patch within that image (1-based)
    - j  -> column index of the patch within that image (1-based)

Patch extraction details
------------------------
- Patches from RGB images are extracted with patch size (shape, shape, 3).
- Patches from binary masks are extracted with patch size (shape, shape).
- The sliding step is computed as: step = int(overlap * shape)

  NOTE:
  Here "overlap" behaves like a stride fraction. For example:
      shape = 256
      overlap = 0.5  -> step = 128  (â‰ˆ50% overlap between neighboring patches)
      overlap = 1.0  -> step = 256  (no overlap: patches just tile the image)

Inputs
------
data_img : list[str]
    Filenames of the original images (used for indexing/traceability).
dict_data : dict
    Dictionary with:
        'image'        -> list of RGB images as np.ndarray [H, W, 3]
        'segmentation' -> list of boolean masks as np.ndarray [H, W]
path_img : str or pathlib.Path
    Directory where extracted image patches will be saved.
path_mask : str or pathlib.Path
    Directory where extracted mask patches will be saved.
shape : int
    Patch size (square side length).
overlap : float
    Fraction that determines the patch step via step = int(overlap * shape).

Outputs
-------
dizionario_patches : dict
    Dictionary with:
        'nrows' -> list of last patch row index for each input image
        'ncols' -> list of last patch col index for each input image
    NOTE: we intentionally keep this behavior for compatibility with downstream code.
